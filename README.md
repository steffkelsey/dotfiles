my dotfiles
===============

I use [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot). The only dependency is
git.

Requirements
------------

Set zsh as my login shell.

  chsh -s /bin/zsh


Install
-------

Clone onto my laptop in the home folder:

  git clone git://github.com/steffkelsey/dotfiles.git

Install:

  ./install

This will create symlinks for config files in my home directory.

You can safely rerun ./install after any major changes are made.
